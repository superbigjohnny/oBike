   + To become a data driven company like us, we collect diversity data, such as coordinate data and so on, but how can we get some valuable information from those data?
      Visualizing them on map, we create a mapping web-service. Through bike-mapping map, heat map and Track path map. We not only can know the riding condition, but operate bikes easily.
